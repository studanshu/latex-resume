This is my Resume in LaTeX.
Fork this repo and edit the fields as necessary and compile your own Resume in pdf.

Requirements
------------
LaTeX and XeTeX must be installed to compile the TeX code.

Linux Users must install the Calibri font. You can get it for free from [here](http://www.fontpalace.com/font-details/Calibri/)

Compile

To compile enter the following command

```bash
$ xelatex Resume.tex
```
This should output a beautiful ```Resume.pdf```.
